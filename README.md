A popular recreation of the arcade game from the 80's Tetris.

## Demo

## Features
* Constructed a multiple level system that allows a user to increase/decrease the speed of the game resulting in more/less points based on selection
* Connected with Rails backend rendering a top ten list of the highest scores  
* Installed an “abort button” feature where the user can flip the game over to hide play

## Technologies
* Vanilla Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* Ruby on Rails

## Minor bugs/Issues

I need to disable event listeners that allows the user to manipulate the shape when pause (technically one could play at a standstill and move shapes without the "gravity effect").  I also ran into an issue accounting for unoccupied/occupied space during shape rotation.
